# Roam Scope

Roam Scope is a basic CRUD app that I made as my Sinatra project for Flatiron School's Online Web Developer Program.

Roam Scope is an attempt to make a system where the insights and recommendations of locals can be captured and curated to help tourists who are new to a city.

## Installation

Do the following:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run bundle install.
3. Run "rake db:migrate" to migrate the databases.
4. Run "rake db:seed" to seed the database with initial data. This is necessary to establish categories.
5. Run "shotgun" to start a local server
6. View the server here: [http://127.0.0.1:9393/](http://127.0.0.1:9393/)

Alternatively, you can see if Roam Scope is still deployed on Heroku:
