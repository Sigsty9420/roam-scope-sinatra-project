# Roam Scope

Roam Scope is a basic CRUD app that I made as my Sinatra project for Flatiron School's Online Web Developer Program.

Roam Scope is an attempt to make a system where the insights and recommendations of locals can be captured and curated to help tourists who are new to a city.

## Installation

Do the following:

1 Clone this repository.
2 Run bundle install.
3 Run "rake db:migrate" to migrate the databases.
4 Run "rake db:seed" to seed the database with initial data. This is necessary to establish categories.
5 Run "shotgun" to start a local server
6 View the server here: [http://127.0.0.1:9393/](http://127.0.0.1:9393/) 

Alternatively, you can see if Roam Scope is still deployed on Heroku over here:  [Roam Scope](https://roam-scope.herokuapp.com/)
